# Installation

    The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly: We recommend that users download Inquirer, Nodemon, and Util for full functionality. These dependencies and the version used can be found in the package.json file.

# Usage

    Simply open the terminal and run the app by entering "node app" - once this has been entered the user will be prompted to respond to a series of questions in their terminal. After answering each question appropriately the app will compile the answers and export to the  README-generated.md file. From here the user can  copy the contents of the file or export the file to be used as their own personal README.md.
